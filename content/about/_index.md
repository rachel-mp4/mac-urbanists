We're studying all the intertwined threads that are our city, and trying to improve urban life by pulling on loose strings at the fringes. \
_general organizers: Adam Schwalbe and Everett Dalton_

We currently consist of several committees focused on different issues:

## [zoning committee](/zoning)
Density empowers pedestrians, reduces ecological load, pushes down rent, diversifies culture. Interventions might look like testifying at public hearings on amendments to the zoning code. \
_organizer: Timotei Chas_

## [reconnect rondo](/rondo)
Rondo is one of many historically black neighborhoods that was displaced by the IHS. Reconnect Rondo is a proposed land bridge to help repair the community. The Reconnect Rondo committee advocates for this alternative in MNDOT's Rethinking I-94 project. \
_organizer: Eli Suppelsa_

## [tactical urbanism](/tactics)
Tactical urbanism is assuming responsibility for the urban environment at the human scale. The tactical urbanist committee is interested in urban agriculture and guerilla crosswalks \
